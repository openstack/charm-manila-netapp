summary: NetApp ONTAP backend configuration for Manila.

description: |
  The Manila share file system service provides a set of services for management
  of shared file systems in a multi-tenant cloud environment. The service
  resembles OpenStack block-based storage management from the OpenStack Block
  Storage service project. With the Shared File Systems service, you can create
  a remote file system, mount the file system on your instances, and then read
  and write data from your instances to and from your file system.

  This charm configures a Manila backend using the NetApp Clustered Data
  ONTAP driver.
